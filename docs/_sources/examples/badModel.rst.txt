:Summary: This file is deliberately designed *not* to follow DESI data model standards
    for test purposes.
:Naming Convention:  This file has a bad naming convention.
    Note that even though there is a regular expression below, the line
    does not start with ``regex:`` so automation will not be able to
    identify it.
