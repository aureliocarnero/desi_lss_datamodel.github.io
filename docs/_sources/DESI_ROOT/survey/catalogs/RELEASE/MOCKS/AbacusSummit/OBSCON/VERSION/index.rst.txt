``${DESI_ROOT}/survey/catalogs/{RELEASE}/MOCKS/AbacusSummit/{OBSCON}/{VERSION}`` host 25 Abacus LSS catalogs (and associated randoms) separated by OBSCON: ``DARK`` or ``BRIGHT`` and followed by internal version, where for ``DARK`` (LRG, ELG and QSO) is ``v4.2`` and for ``BRIGHT`` (BGS) is ``v1``. 

From the landing page, you will find the initial catalog in the Y1 footprint (called forFA files), the lrg_mask file (used only to mask LRGs, present only on the ``DARK`` obscon) and 2 directories called ``altmtl{MOCKREA}`` and ``mock{MOCKREA}`` where ``{MOCKREA}`` is the mock realization from [0,25). 

Here you can find 3 distinct mock flavours depending on the level of realism:
* *Complete*: no fiber assigment effects, just the tracers that are reachable by any DESI fiber (found under ``mock{MOCKREA}``)
* *FFA*: from Fast Fiber Assigment. It estimates fiber assigment probabilistically learning from the data, based on number of passes and local density (found under ``mock{MOCKREA}``)
* *altmtl*: Estimated using the same fba algorithm, passes and hardware configuration as the data (found under ``altmtl{MOCKREA}``). To replicate the fiber assigment processing, follow the instructions in `LSS repo`_. 


For one realization in OBSCON = ``DARK``, we have also estimated PIP weights based on 128 fba repetitions (see the AltMTL method; `Lasker et al. (2025)`_)

Details about the content and production of the LSS catalogs that we follow for the mocks are found in `Ross et al. (2025)`_
Details comparing the three mock flavous can be found in `Bianchi et al. (2025)`_
