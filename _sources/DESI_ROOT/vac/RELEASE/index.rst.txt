RELEASE
=======

``${DESI_ROOT}/vac/RELEASE`` contains the Value Added Catalogs (VAC) associated with a
particular data release. The value of ``RELEASE`` will typically be ``edr``, ``dr1``, and so on. 

In the case of the LSS catalogs, only the EDR release is host under the vac directory. For Data Releases (DR), the LSS catalos sits under ``${DESI_ROOT}/survey/catalogs`` 

Within this directory, each VAC will have a unique name.

Only some VACs include data model descriptions here;
see https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/releases/edr/#value-added-catalogs
for a full list of DESI Early Data Release VACs and their data models.
