``$DESI_ROOT/vac/edr/lss`` contains LSS catalogs for EDR, reading from most other DESI products, ready for archiving with
the early data release. Intermediate files are saved, until we build the clustering-ready catalogs
(including weights).

``v2.0`` represents the final EDR LSS version (we use v2.0 in order to distinguish these catalogs from an internal DESI earlier v1.0 version).

The final clustering-ready catalogs can be found under :ref:`LSScats/clustering<clustering>`, together with the random samples for the same target types.
Information about the different target types and the use of the different weights can be found in `EDR. DESI Collaboration (2024)`_ and in the explanation of :ref:`LSScats<lsscats>` subdirectory.

The catalogs are generated using tools from github_lss_repository_. For EDR we use the `github release tag v2.0.0-EDR`_
