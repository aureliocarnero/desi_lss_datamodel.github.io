mock FFA and COMPLETE clustering catalogs
=========================================

:Summary: For each target type, LSS catalogs for the data, ready to be used for clustering measurements, are provided.
:Naming Convention: ``{TARGET}_{FLAVOUR}_{GALCAP}_clustering.dat.fits``, where ``{TARGET}`` is the target: ``QSO``, ``ELG_LOP``, ``LRG``, 
                    for dark or ``BGS_BRIGHT-21.5`` for bright. ``{FLAVOUR}`` is ``ffa`` or ``complete`` and ``{GALCAP}`` is the Galactic hemisphere region ``NGC`` or ``SGC``.
:Regex: ``[A-Za-z0-9._+-]+_(ffa|complete)+_(NGC|SGC)_clustering\.dat\.fits``
