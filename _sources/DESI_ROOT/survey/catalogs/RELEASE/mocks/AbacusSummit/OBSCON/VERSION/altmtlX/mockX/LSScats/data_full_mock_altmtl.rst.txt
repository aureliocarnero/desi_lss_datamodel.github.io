==================
MOCK full catalogs
==================

:Summary: mock catalogs containing information on all targets identified as reachable by DESI fiberassign, with one entry for each. The files are split by target type and whether of not vetos for angular positions and healpix maps have been applied
:Naming Convention: ``{TARGET}_full{VETO}.dat.fits``, where ``{TARGET}`` is the target type: ``QSO``, ``ELG_LOPnotqso``, ``LRG``, for dark or ``BGS_ANY``, ``BGS_BRIGHT`` or ``BGS_BRIGHT-21.5`` for bright. ``{VETO}`` is ``_noveto`` if vetos have not been applied, blank if vetos have been applied and ``_HPmapcut`` if both vetos and healpix map cuts have been applied.
:Regex: ``[A-Za-z0-9._+-]+_full(|_HPmapcut|_noveto)\.dat\.fits``
:File Type: FITS, 1 GB

Notes and Examples
==================

Optional columns:

* ``BGS_TARGET``, ``R_MAG_ABS``, ``TSNR2_BGS`` and ``GOODTSNR`` only present in BGS samples.
* ``lrg_mask`` only present in LRG samples.

.. warning::

        For OBSCON = dark, dtypes of RA,DEC is float32, instead of float64
