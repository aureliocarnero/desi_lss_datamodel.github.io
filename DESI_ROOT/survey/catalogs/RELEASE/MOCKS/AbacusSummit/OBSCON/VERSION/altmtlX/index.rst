=====================
AltMTL MOCK DIRECTORY
=====================

``${DESI_ROOT}/survey/catalogs/RELEASE/MOCKS/AbacusSummit/OBSCON/VERSION/altmtl{MOCKREA}`` host the AltMTL LSS mock catalogs (and associated randoms) for each ``{MOCKREA}`` realization.

Here you will find two directories, fbaX contains the compilation of running fiber assigment after running the altmtl pipeline (not public, but replicated `following the instructions in LSS code`_) and mockX contains intermediate files and final clustering files (unders LSScats directory, following the same structure as the data)
