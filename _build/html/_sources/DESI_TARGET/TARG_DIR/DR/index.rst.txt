``DR`` is the Data Release of imaging from the Legacy Surveys as a drX.Y
string. The X refers to the primary Data Release integer and the Y is only
rarely used for critical reprocessing of a Data Release (*e.g.* dr7.1)
Under each Data Release, data are grouped according to the release
number (tag) of the desitarget code version on GitHub.
